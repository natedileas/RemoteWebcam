Develeoped and tested with python 3 and opencv 3.2

camera.py: should be run on the machine with the webcam
    - requires opencv
    - depends on server.py

example.py: should be run on the machine you want to do stuff on
    - requires opencv
    - depends on server.py

    Use this as a template, diaply in whatever framework. I see about a second of lag at about 20 fps with this example tool.
